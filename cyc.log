We aimed to analyse AU patterns for HI treatment in German acute care hospitals. METHODS We analysed data from the German 2022 point prevalence survey (PPS) on AU and healthcare-associated infections, using the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control protocol across 252 hospitals. Analyses focused on key infection prevention and control (IPC), antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) indicators and AU for HI, categorised by the World Health Organisation AWaRe classification. Comparisons were made to the previous national PPS in 2016 and 2011. RESULTS A total of 22 422 antimicrobial prescriptions were recorded in 66 586 patients. HI treatment accounted for 20% of AU. Penicillins with beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins accounted for over 50% of AU for HI treatment. Watch antimicrobials dominated HI treatment prescriptions, accounting for around 62% of use, particularly in respiratory infections, while use of Access antimicrobials was limited (24%).

Over time, IPC indicators, such as alcohol-based hand rub consumption and IPC staffing, improved significantly, yet AMS staffing remained low and comprehensive hospital-wide post-prescription reviews were limited to around a quarter of hospitals.

The primary objective was to determine average time to achieve a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)\xa090 response (50% of patients) for individual biologics or targeted therapies. Secondary outcomes included the average time to achieve a PASI\xa075 response (50% of patients), as well as PASI\xa090 and PASI\xa075 responses over the first 16\xa0weeks of therapy. METHODS A systematic targeted literature review was conducted to identify phase\xa0III and IV randomised, double-blinded trials according to pre-specified eligibility criteria that investigated interleukin (IL)-12/23 inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. Using proportions of patients achieving PASI\xa090 or 75 responses over 16\xa0weeks, network meta-analyses were conducted to estimate response over time. This was presented as curves, and TOA was summarized as median time to reach the 50th percentile. RESULTS Forty-five trials were included in the main analyses. The IL-17 inhibitors bimekizumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab, and secukinumab 300\xa0mg were estimated to provide the earliest onset of PASI\xa090 response at approximately 6 to 8\xa0weeks. This was followed by the IL-23 inhibitors risankizumab and guselkumab at approximately 9-10\xa0weeks, and the IL-12/23 inhibitor at 11-12\xa0weeks. Although wide and overlapping credible intervals and similar point estimates were observed, these results suggest onset of action does not vary greatly across biologics in these classes. Onset of PASI\xa090 response could not be estimated by the model for tildrakizumab, and JAK and PDE4 inhibitors. Onset of PASI\xa075 response showed similar trends to PASI\xa090 response. CONCLUSIONS IL-17 inhibitors, followed by IL-23 inhibitors, have the most rapid TOA among PsO biologics evaluated; any differences in onset of action between specific agents within the same drug class are not statistically or clinically significant. These analyses will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment decisions for their patients.  Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is a chronic condition that affects approximately 125\xa0million people worldwide. The skin lesions in plaque psoriasis are red, scaly, and often itchy. In addition, patients with plaque psoriasis may have reduced quality of life. As an increasing number of treatments have become available for managing plaque psoriasis, determining the most appropriate therapy for individual patients can be complex. When making treatment decisions, clinicians consider several factors, including how long it will take for a patient to see clinical benefit from a treatment, otherwise known as time to onset of action. The time to onset of action of a treatment is determined by analysing changes in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), a commonly used tool to assess the severity of psoriasis, over time. Commonly assessed outcomes in psoriasis clinical trials include a 90% and a 75% reduction in PASI scores (i.e. PASI\xa090 and PASI\xa075, respectively). We aimed to assess the average time to onset of action of various psoriasis treatments using data reported from 45 clinical trials. The proportion of patients achieving a PASI\xa075 or 90 response by week\xa016 was used in the analysis.

The toxicity of a mixture of 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone and 4-MBC showed addictive effect on C. vulgaris, while the toxicity of mixtures of 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone and 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone, 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone and 4-MBC as well as 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone, 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone and 4-MBC all showed antagonistic effect on C. vulgaris. The induced no-effect concentrations of 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone, 2,4,4'-trihydroxybenzophenone and 4-MBC by the assessment factor (AF) method were 0.0125, 0.00350 and 0.000169 mg/L, respectively.", 'journalIssueTitle': <Element 'Title' at 0x106626fc0>, 'journalIssueVolume': '50', 'journalIssuePubDateYear': '2023', 'authorList': [{}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}], 'articleIdList': [{'type': {'pubmed'}, 'id': {'33831101'}}, {'type': {'pmc'}, 'id': {'PMC8031759'}}, {'type': {'doi'}, 'id': {'10.1371/journal.pone.0249915'}}, {'type': {'pii'}, 'id': {'PONE-D-21-02448'}}]}}

The facial care category is the most relevant in this industry, and within it, the sensitive skin segment occupies a prominent position. This work analyzed the use of marine ingredients in 88 facial cosmetics for sensitive skin from multinational brands, as well as their composition and the scientific evidence that supports their efficacy. Marine ingredients were used in 27% of the cosmetic products for sensitive skin and included the species Laminaria ochroleuca, Ascophyllum nodosum (brown macroalgae), Asparagopsis armata (red macroalgae), and Chlorella vulgaris (microalgae). Carotenoids, polysaccharides, and lipids are the chemical classes highlighted in these preparations. Two ingredients, namely the Ascophyllum nodosum extract and Asparagopsis armata extracts, present clinical evidence supporting their use for sensitive skin. Overall, marine ingredients used in cosmetics for sensitive skin are proposed to reduce skin inflammation and improve the barrier function. Marine-derived preparations constitute promising active ingredients for sensitive skin cosmetic products. Their in-depth study, focusing on the extracted metabolites, randomized placebo-controlled studies including volunteers with sensitive skin, and the use of extraction methods that are more profitable may provide a great opportunity for the cosmetic industry.', 'journalIssueTitle': 'Marine drugs', 'journalIssueVolume': '19', 'journalIssuePubDateYear': '2021', 'authorList': [{'LastName': 'Ferreira', 'Initials': 'MS'}, {'LastName': 'Resende', 'Initials': 'DISP'}, {'LastName': 'Lobo', 'Initials': 'JMS'}, {'LastName': 'Sousa', 'Initials': 'E'}, {'LastName': 'Almeida', 'Initials': 'IF'}], 'articleIdList': [{'type': {'pubmed'}, 'id': {'34436303'}}, {'type': {'pmc'}, 'id': {'PMC8398991'}}, {'type': {'doi'}, 'id': {'10.3390/md19080464'}}, {'type': {'pii'}, 'id': {'md19080464'}}]}}
